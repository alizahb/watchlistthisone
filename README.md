Watchlist allows users to create categorized lists of movies they plan to see. Are you in a spooky mood? Or maybe it's more of a romantic comedy kind of night? 
Maybe you want a list of films that inspire existential dread or one that makes you want to move to Italy. Maybe you're in the mood to watch Nicolas Cage be weird but don't know where to start.   
Watchlist allows you to search movie information and save those titles to your descriptively named list so you can find them easily when you're ready to watch.
